# AI-survey-question

1.  In the AI survey questions folder, you will implement a solver for the Satisfiability (SAT) problem. In particular, you will implement the Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland (DPLL) algorithm. Your input is in conjunctive normal form (CNF). You should only edit the DPLLsat.py.

2. AI survey questions 2 focuses on detecting handwritten prime digits with neural networks. You will need to implement compute_activiations, compute_gradients, and update_weights functions in layers.py. You will also need to implement compute_activations and compute_gradients in the neural_network.py. Specific requirements are included in the in python files.

3. In AI survey qeustions 3, you will use the Posterior Decoding and Viterbi algorithms on Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to detect C/G rich regions in a DNA sequence. You need to implement two function in a3_template.py. HMM.viterbi() uses the Viterbi algorithm to calculate the most likely sequence of sstates given a sequence of DNA characters. HMM.posterior uses the smoothing algorithm to compute the posterior distribution of the state at a given position. Specific requirements are included in the python files.

4. In AI survey questions 4, your Pac-Man agent will find paths through his maze world, both to reach a particular location and to collect food efficiently. You will build general search algorithms and apply them to Pac-Man scenarios. Specific requirements are included in the python files.
