# AI-survey-question

1.  In the AI survey questions folder, you will implement a solver for the Satisfiability (SAT) problem. In particular, you will implement the Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland (DPLL) algorithm. Your input is in conjunctive normal form (CNF). You should only edit the DPLLsat.py.

2. Ai survey questions 2 focuses on detecting handwritten prime digits with neural networks. You will need to implement compute_activiations, compute_gradients, and update_weights functions in layers.py. You will also need to implement compute_activations and compute_gradients in the neural_network.py. Specific requirements are included in the in python files.
